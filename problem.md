## Overview ##
-------------
(We first discuss **2D** case only. )
Consider a $ w\times h$  binary image $I$ contains a single shape, and it's polygon representation  $S$.
Pixels in $I$ can be classified into shape pixels $P_s$ (white) and background pixels $P_b$ (black).

> Our goal is given the shape pixels $P_s$, we want to recover it's shape polygon $S$.
