## Summary

- This week I worked on minimizing the energy, please see the webpage at:  
<http://jdily.github.io/progress/2015/10/02/Optimization-draft/>

- And compare the results using different terms, i.e. use each term independently.
<https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~ichaos/research/nbview/term%20comparison%20-%20cases.html>

- And I also compare the ground truth with the optimized results in terms of energy:

- Still work on a potential problem of current energy, please see
