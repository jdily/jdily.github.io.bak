## Notes##

- add an normalization process in the optimization to deal with the problem described in 
<http://jdily.github.io/draft/2015/10/06/Energy-Discussion/>  
	- verify the new distance weighting using ground truth examples.
	- implement the alternative optimization process to generate desired results.

- add a bias into both energy terms, because for most of the curves, the laplacian and bi-laplacian may not be exactly 0. (i.e. we may not really want zero in our results)
	- also, verify this from some ground truth examples, i.e. for each vertex, compute both laplacian and bi-laplacian.
	- and in the end we can **learn** this bias as learning the prior (also, we can think about whether to keep the weights or not, because it is also kind of prior...)

- if anyone want to find the results or discussion for the original functions, please see
