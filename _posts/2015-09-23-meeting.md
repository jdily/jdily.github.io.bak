## Importants##
Next meeting : Sep 29 (Tue), 1:00 pm  

## Notes##
- Visualization should be changed so that we can see the line clearer.
- Smoothness issue
	- leverage local laplacian, i.e. describe a pixel crossing with two neighbors.
	- find out what we want, i.e. the optimization function.
	- We can 
		- use network results as initial value (i.e. using network to do the feature pattern->crossing value mapping, because it's hard to formulate as a numerical optimization.)
		- and do a post-optimization for smoothness (this one is easier to do optimization.)  
		- Also, we can try to incorporate this process into the network, as a new layer.
	- The current result can be consider as first-order prediction, we can try to make the loss (objective) function complicated and try to predict some other things.
	- For interactive usage, if post-optimization (globally) is needed, we can only do it once a while, but not after every update.
 

## Action Items##
1. generate double feature set -> for reflective symmetries
2. Run experiment -> use triangle and rect to reconstruct arrow.
3. drafting the introduction, including notation and target optimization function.
4. experiment with the two step optimization including laplacian
5. integrate caffe model into c++
6. Implement the new representation and compare..
